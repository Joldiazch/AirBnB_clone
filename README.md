## Description Project Command Interprete
Project Command Iterpreter HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage from Back-End in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class

- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## How to start it

### Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the
[FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) class.

Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object is loaded/re-loaded from 
any class instances stored in the JSON file `file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the `storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

### Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
